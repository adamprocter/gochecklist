Contributions are welcome and encouraged.  For the time being, I would like to
classify contributions into two categories:

  1. trivial improvements of verbiage, grammar, or other matters of textual
     maintenance and facts.

     For these, simply create a pull request and issue it.  Mergers should be
     trivial.

  2. significant rewrites, deletions, or additions of content.

     For these, I would like to get a measure of community opinion before
     incorporating carte blanche.


No matter what, a contribution should comply to the guidelines found in this
repository.
