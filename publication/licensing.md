# Overview
Your project should have a license associated with it.


# Why
A license clarifies how the project can be used, what your rights and
obligations are, etc.  Not having a license creates ambiguity for your users,
and may prevent them from using your project out of fear of failing to comply
with rules and subsequent litigation.


# How
The process of choosing and applying a license is out of the scope of this
document.  Here are a couple of resources that may help for open source
cases:

  1. GitHub's [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/)

  2. [Open Source Initiative Listings](http://opensource.org/licenses)



# What
The licensing information should be present in the project's root directory and
referenced from the [documentation entrypoint](documentation_entrypoint.md).
