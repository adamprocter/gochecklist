# Overview
Your project should be capable of being compiled.


# Why
A project is unusable if it is unbuildable.  Anything unbuildable is noise to
prospective users.


# How
The project should be buildable by the [go tool](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) or
alternative scaffolding, like shell script or makefile.


# See Also
[build_instructions.md](build_instructions.md) has a number of useful pieces of
advice.
