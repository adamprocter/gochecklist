# Overview
Your project should include a single, centralized documentation entrypoint that
offers pertinent information: what the package is and does, how to build it,
use it, test it, contribute to it, what license it is under, etc.


# Why
Customers abandon projects that are not easy to grok.  Time is expensive, and
not offering that simple, one-stop-shop documentation point imposes _just that
extra cost_ that tips the time scale.


# How
How this is done needn't be described too far in-depth.  It is really up to you.

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) seems to offer a good
compromise between human-readability and machine-enhanced presentation layer.

At a minimum, the central document should include the following:

  1. what the package is and does;
  
  2. how one uses it;
    
  3. how one installs it;
  
  4. what license it is under;

  5. who built it;

  6. how to test it and use the continuous build;

  7. how to get in contact with its maintainers;

  8. how to report issues; and

  9. how to contribute.


If these points are defined in more concrete documentation elsewhere, the
central document should make allusion to it&mdash;without necessarily
duplicating the content ad nauseum.
