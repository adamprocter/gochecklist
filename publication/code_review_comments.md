# Overview
Your project should meaningfully incorporate the commentary from
[Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

# How
Read, internalize, and apply these principles.  They change periodically, and
wisdom brought from experience gives you new opportunities and way to apply
them.
