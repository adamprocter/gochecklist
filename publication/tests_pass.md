# Overview
Your project's tests should pass.


# Why
A project is unusable if its tests do not pass.  Anything errant is noise to
prospective users.


# How
The project should be testable by the [go tool](https://golang.org/cmd/go/) or
alternative scaffolding, like shell script or makefile.


# See Also
[test_instructions.md](test_instructions.md) has a number of useful pieces of
advice.
